Keep it simple stupid machine learning AI framework for javascript ML

Finally, the breakthrough that AI and ML have been waiting for:
As of May 8th, 2022, i present the first ever AI that has been designed to think and store data the same way as a human
toddler.  Previous AIs have been training models with millions of images but gotten nowhere, but that is to be expected!
Try teaching someone what a zebra is by showing them a book full of binary code... not so easy.. might take a million books before a pattern becomes obvious...

but what if we broke down how we defined a zebra: it has four legs, a small tail, and black and white stripes.  Now just have a database that describes thos things and a simple model for each one to be independently recognized..

i have done the easy part of making AI simple.. you just have to do the easy modeling and implement it into my code (or just rewrite it because its simple as can be.
